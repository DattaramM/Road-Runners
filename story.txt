Butler was a fan of Subway Surfers Game. He wanted to make a game like Subway Surfers. Making Subway Surfers game in 3D was quite
complicated, so he decided to make the game in 2D. He was not having some assets necessary for the game but he had a road image which 
can be the background of the game. He choosed the character of the game 'Jake'(the main character of Subway Surfers) as the player.
He was thinking that the name 'Subway Surfers' is not suitable to the game. So he named the game as 'Roadway-Runners' and finally
created the whole game in javascript.
